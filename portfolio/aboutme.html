            <p class="about">If you have made it this far, you must really want to get to know me. Again, my name is Jason Yale. I am married and currently have two children with one on the way. I am a husband and a father first. My goal in this life is to provide for my family. I have learned this skill of coding to improve and to reach that goal of providing in a better way. 

            <br><br>Coding is perfect for me. “But I still love technology….. Always and forever.” I love anything that has to do with technology. It fascinates me. But also, I am a problem-solver. Coding is amazing in that aspect. “Why doesn’t this website/app work?” That’s where I come in. You will probably never meet a more determined and competitive person. I don’t quit or give up. I will set goals and achieve them no matter what. 

            <br><br>A little about me. I am from Washington State. I am very active. I participate in Crossfit 5 days a week. I have to fuel that competitive side of me somehow. Crossfit satisfies that. Very into nutrition. Pretty much any way of trying to improve myself. Often I think, “How can I improve on this?” Again I do not like to be second in anything, so I look for ways of improvement. I am very proud of what I have accomplished so far in life. It’s been a journey and I have been very blessed. 

            <br><br>The End.
