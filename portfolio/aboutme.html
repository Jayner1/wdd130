            This page is if the visitor is serious about hiring me. To make it all the way to the about me page I feel like is icing on the cake. This is the glitter of all the pages. It is to show that I am human and have a personality. I will place images strategically on this page to humanize myself. This page will be good for telling the visitor more about me. One of my main missions for this page is to create simple ways to contact me. I want to keep this page very simple. Simplicity is key in my opinion. You can do so much on this page that it ruins the other pages the visitor has been too. This page will also have a header and a footer. Every page needs to have these two components. I want to maintain consistency and cohesion through every page. My goal is to make the footer icons hoverable and clickable and they will direct the visitor to the desired page. For example: GitHub, Gmail, and Linkedin.
