      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is the first impression. The first 10 seconds they look at my page has to draw in employers and make them have the desire to click around more. Employers will come to this site if they are interested in hiring me. They will want to come to my portfolio site to see my work and determine if my hard work and talent are good enough for their business. They have goals and a vision for their business, can I help them accomplish those goals? Visitors will want to know what languages I can write in. They will want to see if I am good at web design. Probably want to learn more about me (will have an aboutme.html page). Also what type of websites I have and can make. My home page will have certain styling choices that need to match the other pages as well. My plan is to have each page feed off of each other. I want every page to be cohesive. Each page will have a footer that has icons to click on for gmail, linkedin, and github. They will be directed to the desired sites. Each page will also consist of a navigation bar. As of right now my plan is to go with a hamburger style menu. This navigation bar will be in the header. I will also include my logo in the header.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="img\jason.png" alt="Me">
        <img src="img\spaghetti_img.jpg" alt="websites picture">
        <img src="img\gmail.png" alt="gmail">
        <img src="img\linkedin.png" alt="linkedin">

      </ul>
      <h3>Websites</h3>
      <p>
        This page will introduce the visitor to all the websites I have created. My websites page will be the main page. The meat and potatoes of the website. I want to show off my work to entice future employers. This page is to show the different languages I can write in. It shows the design capabilities I possess. I want to have good hover effects for the different websites. Make it simple yet enticing for the visitors. The different websites I want to showcase are: Recipe Site, Chat app, Pokedex, rafting site, and myFlix site (movie database). These different sites use different languages. So I will have quick details under the website hover(clickable) pictures that tell what languages each specific site used and different tools, libraries, and databases they used as well. Again each page will have a header and a footer. The header will consist of the logo and hamburger menu. The footer icons to the different ways of contacting me. My goal is to make the footer icons hoverable and clickable and they will direct the visitor to the desired page. For example: GitHub, Gmail, and Linkedin.

        <img src="img/movies.jpg" alt="movies">


      </ul>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        This page is if the visitor is serious about hiring me. To make it all the way to the about me page I feel like is icing on the cake. This is the glitter of all the pages. It is to show that I am human and have a personality. I will place images strategically on this page to humanize myself. This page will be good for telling the visitor more about me. One of my main missions for this page is to create simple ways to contact me. I want to keep this page very simple. Simplicity is key in my opinion. You can do so much on this page that it ruins the other pages the visitor has been too. This page will also have a header and a footer. Every page needs to have these two components. I want to maintain consistency and cohesion through every page. My goal is to make the footer icons hoverable and clickable and they will direct the visitor to the desired page. For example: GitHub, Gmail, and Linkedin.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I am going to try to use a half image on the left side of the page. 
      </p>
      <img src="img\homepage1.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Websites</h3>
      <p>         
        Images will be clickable that bring the user to each website I want to showcase.
      </p>
      <img src="img\websites.png" alt="websites wireframe">

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>         
        The two images will be a slideshow. Showing different pictures of myself and other images I want to showcase.
