            This is the first impression. The first 10 seconds they look at my page has to draw in employers and make them have the desire to click around more. Employers will come to this site if they are interested in hiring me. They will want to come to my portfolio site to see my work and determine if my hard work and talent are good enough for their business. They have goals and a vision for their business, can I help them accomplish those goals? Visitors will want to know what languages I can write in. They will want to see if I am good at web design. Probably want to learn more about me (will have an aboutme.html page). Also what type of websites I have and can make. My home page will have certain styling choices that need to match the other pages as well. My plan is to have each page feed off of each other. I want every page to be cohesive. Each page will have a footer that has icons to click on for gmail, linkedin, and github. They will be directed to the desired sites. Each page will also consist of a navigation bar. As of right now my plan is to go with a hamburger style menu. This navigation bar will be in the header. I will also include my logo in the header.
