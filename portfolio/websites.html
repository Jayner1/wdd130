            This page will introduce the visitor to all the websites I have created. My websites page will be the main page. The meat and potatoes of the website. I want to show off my work to entice future employers. This page is to show the different languages I can write in. It shows the design capabilities I possess. I want to have good hover effects for the different websites. Make it simple yet enticing for the visitors. The different websites I want to showcase are: Recipe Site, Chat app, Pokedex, rafting site, and myFlix site (movie database). These different sites use different languages. So I will have quick details under the website hover(clickable) pictures that tell what languages each specific site used and different tools, libraries, and databases they used as well. Again each page will have a header and a footer. The header will consist of the logo and hamburger menu. The footer icons to the different ways of contacting me. My goal is to make the footer icons hoverable and clickable and they will direct the visitor to the desired page. For example: GitHub, Gmail, and Linkedin.
